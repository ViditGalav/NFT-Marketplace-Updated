# Project Title: NFTMarketplace: A Decentralized NFT Marketplace on Ethereum

This full-stack project demonstrates a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages smart contracts for secure transactions and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the marketplace.



## Key Features

NFT Creation and Listing: Users can create and list their own NFTs for sale.

Browsing and Purchasing: Browse available NFTs and purchase them directly with ETH (Ethereum's native cryptocurrency).

Ownership Tracking: Securely tracks ownership of NFTs on the blockchain.

Listing Fee: A small fee is charged to list NFTs, providing a revenue stream for the marketplace owner.

Upgradeable Listing Price: The marketplace owner can adjust the listing fee.


## Technical Overview

Blockchain: Ethereum (Chosen for its established NFT standards, smart contract capabilities, and decentralized nature)


Smart Contracts:

getAllNFTs(): Retrieves all listed NFTs.

getMyNFTs(): Fetches NFTs owned or listed by the current user.

executeSale(uint256 tokenId): Completes the purchase of an NFT.

updateListPrice(uint256 _listPrice): Updates the listing fee (owner only).
